Write a Java program to create a class
Calculator with a methods called add(),
substract(), multiply(), divide().
Each of these methods should have 2
implementations with amount/types of arguments;

Example of add:
+ add(int: a, int: b): int;
+ add(double a, double b): int;

Note: divide() methods should throw an exception when dividing to zero

Output:
Sum of 2 and 3: 5
Sum of 2.5 and 3.5: 6.0
Difference between 5 and 3: 2
Difference between 5.5 and 3.2: 2.3
Product of 2 and 3: 6
Product of 2.5 and -4: -10.0
Division of 10 by 2: 5.0
Error: Division by zero!
