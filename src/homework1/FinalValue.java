    /*
    There is a programming language
    with only four operations and one variable X:

    ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
    --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
    Initially, the value of X is 0.

    Given an array of strings operations containing
    a list of operations, return the final value
    of X after performing all the operations.

    Example 1:

    Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
    Initially, X = 0.
    --X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
    X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
    X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
    Example 2:

    Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
    Initially, X = 0.
    ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
    ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
    X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
    Example 3:

    Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
    Initially, X = 0.
    X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
    ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
    --X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
    X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.



    operations = "x++", "x--", "x++", "++x", "--x"
    x = 0;
    x++ -> x + 1 = 1;
    x-- -> x - 1 = 0;
    x++ -> x + 1 = 1;
    ++x -> 1 + x = 2;
